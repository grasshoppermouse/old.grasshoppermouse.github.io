    <div class="article-content">
      <p>Academic success is largely determined by a count of one&rsquo;s publications vs. years since entering graduate school, with publications weighted by the prestige of the journal in which they appear. So, the gals and guys with the most pubs must be the best scholars, right? I&rsquo;ve been playing by those rules, but it&rsquo;s increasingly clear that those rules are leading to a lot of crappy scholarship.</p>

<p>A publication is supposed to report an important new fact about the world. In my field of anthropology, the bare minimum number of pubs per year is about three. This means that, each year, I must discover three important new things about the world. Yes, <em>new</em>. Yes, <em>important</em>.</p>

<p>That, during childhood, the increase in height is correlated with an increase in weight is important, but it&rsquo;s not new. That there are, say, exactly 972 maple seeds clogging my gutter is new, but it&rsquo;s not important.</p>

<p>For those of us studying human behavior, is that realistic?</p>

<p>To meet my pub quota, I have to make 3 good calls, e.g., x really is correlated with y. Now, if I pick an x and y that everyone already knows are correlated, like height and weight, I haven&rsquo;t discovered anything. But what if I pick x and y that <em>might</em> be correlated, but no one really knows? Let&rsquo;s say there is a 50% chance that they are correlated. If they are, it&rsquo;s moderately surprising and moderately important (let&rsquo;s say). OK, so now I have to do that three times, with three different pairs of x&rsquo;s and y&rsquo;s (three different x&rsquo;s, and three different y&rsquo;s). What are the chances that in all three studies, x really is correlated with y? Well, it&rsquo;s .5 x .5 x .5 = 0.125.</p>

<p>So, the chances that my three studies are all publishable is only 1 in 8. Fuck. How many studies do I have to do to make my quota, with, say, 90% probability?</p>

<p>As every quantitative scholar knows, in order to publish, one must have &ldquo;statistically significant&rdquo; results: p &lt; 0.05. As I discussed in my last post, for that p-value to mean anything, the researcher must have made her call <em>before</em> looking at the data.</p>
